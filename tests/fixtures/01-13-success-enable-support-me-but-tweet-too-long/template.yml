    We have a new support thank you @{{ twitter-username }}. What we are trying in this test is that we would like to check if the content of a tweet is very long already we should not add an extra hashtag even if the user would like to support us with the option supportME.. let's see
github:
  follow: true
  add-star: true
  create-issue:
    title: {{ github-repo }} > Thank you for your contribution
    body: |
